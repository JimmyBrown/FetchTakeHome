## FetchRewards Coding Exercise

Built using Xcode 12.4 and the latest version of Swift 5. 

**Dependencies**

No dependencies were used. Everything is native Swift.

**Notes**

 - [ ] Built using standard MVC architecture. 
 
 - [ ] I used Storyboards. The requirements did not specify but the job description mentioned the use of Storyboards. I noticed this after I had half the UI done programmatically.
